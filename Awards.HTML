<br><b><u>Nobel Prize:</u><br></b>
In 1913, Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his collection Gitanjali, which was first published in London in 1912. The Nobel Prize for Rabindranath Tagore was stolen from the Visva Bharati University’s vault in 2004. Soon after the theft, the Nobel Academy sent the Vishwa Bharati Chancellor a replacement medal in gold and bronze. These are kept at the Shantiniketan museum alongside other Tagore relics.
<br><b><u>Knighthood:</u><br></b>
In 1915, two years after receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature, Rabindranath Tagore was knighted. In protest of the April 13 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, he returned the title on May 31, 1919. Since it was the most prestigious award conferred to Britain’s most valuable person, Britishers not only in India but also in Britain took the return of the knighthood award seriously.
<br><b><u>Doctorate of Literature:</u><br></b>
Rabindranath Tagore was conferred with Doctorate of Literature by Oxford University in a special ceremony held in Santiniketan in 1940.<br></b>
