Tagore's politics exhibited remarkable ambivalence. On the other hand, he denounced European imperialism and at times expressed full support for Indian nationalists. On the other hand, he abhorred the Swadeshi movement, denouncing it in his scathing September 1925 essay ``The Cult of the Charkha'' (which referred to elements of Gandhianism and the Non-Cooperation Movement). For example, on July 22, 1904, in response to a suggestion by the British that Bengal should be partitioned, an agitated Tagore began a lecture entitled 'Swadeshi Samaj' ('Union of the Motherland'). Instead, he proposed an alternative. Solution: Comprehensive restructuring of rural Bengal on a self-help basis. Furthermore, Tagore viewed British rule in India as "a political symptom of our social ills" and urged Indians to accept that "there is nothing wrong with blind revolution, but we need steady and purposeful education." I urged him to do so. Along these lines, Tagore denounced. He considers nationalism to be one of humanity's biggest problems. "A nation...is the aspect assumed by an entire nation when organized for mechanical purposes," he wrote, and that purpose is often a "grandiose, magnified form of individual self-interest." ``can be'' is associated with ``selfishness.'' During his extensive travels, he formed a vision of unifying East and West. He was then struck by the rise in nationalism seen in Germany and other countries before World War II. Thus Tagore gave a series of lectures on nationalism. Although well received in most of Europe, it was largely ignored or criticized in Japan and the United States. However, Tagore wrote songs praising the Indian independence movement. On 30 May 1919, he renounced his knighthood, awarded to him by Lord Hardinge in 1915, in protest of the Amritsar Massacre (Jallianwallah Bagh), in which British soldiers killed at least 379 unarmed civilians. He was also instrumental in resolving the dispute between Gandhi and Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. These included Ambedkar's insistence on separate constituencies for untouchables and Gandhi's announcement of a rapid policy of 'death to death' from September 20, 1932, in protest of the concessions. . The course of a meeting between the Danish critic Georg Brandes and his secretary in 1920. Tagore also strongly criticized the orthodox memorization-based education system introduced in India under Indian rule. He satirizes this in his short story 'Training a Parrot', in which a bird that eventually dies is kept in a cage by its tutor and forced to feed pages torn from a book. being sent. These views were crystallized in the experimental school of Santiniketan ("abode of peace"), established in 1901 on the premises of an estate in West Bengal inherited from his father.  Tagore devoted a great deal of energy to fundraising for Santiniketan, even donating all of his Nobel prize money. Today, Tagore's school is a central university under the jurisdiction of the Indian government.</b><br>
