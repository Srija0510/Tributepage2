<br><b>Rabindranath Tagore</b>(nicknamed "Rabi") was born on 7 May 1861 in the<b>Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta,</b>the son of Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–1875).<b>Rabindranath Tagore was an Indian poet, writer, playwriter, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter.</b>He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the<b>"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali,</b>he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as<b>"the Bard of Bengal",</b>Tagore was known by sobriquets:<b>Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.</b><br>
A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the <b>pseudonym Bhanusiha ("Sun Lion"),</b>which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his founding of <b>Visva-Bharati University.</b><br>
Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal.<b>Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.</b>His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's<b>"Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla".</b>The Sri Lankan national anthem was also inspired by his work.
